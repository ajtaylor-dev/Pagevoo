- Hero section updated:
  - Main headline: "Launch your business website in minutes, not months"
  - Subheadline: "Industry-specific websites with booking, ordering, CMS, and everything your business needs — ready to go"
- Feature sections repositioned:
  - "What is Pagevoo?" - Emphasizes no coding, ready-to-launch
  - "Everything Included" (was "PLATFORM 1.0") - Focus on complete business solution
  - Call-to-action: "Get Started Today" (was "Get Started Free")
  - Removed unverifiable "thousands of businesses" claim

**Pages Created:**
1. **Solutions Page** - Industry-specific solutions (Restaurants, Barbershops, Pizza Shops, Cafes, Gyms, Salons)
2. **What's Included Page** - All built-in features (Booking, Ordering, CMS, Galleries, Customer Management, Blog/Forums)
3. **Pricing Page** - Three tiers: Brochure (£19/mo), Niche (£39/mo), Pro (£59/mo)
4. **Support Page** - Contact, documentation, video tutorials
