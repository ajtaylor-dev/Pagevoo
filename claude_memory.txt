**Pricing Tiers:**
- Brochure (£19/mo): Basic website features
- Niche (£39/mo): Enhanced features
- Pro (£59/mo): Full features including collaborator management

**Files Created This Session:**
- app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/CollaboratorController.php
- app/Http/Controllers/Api/V1/GroupController.php
- app/Models/Group.php
- database/migrations/2025_10_02_114023_create_groups_table.php
- database/migrations/2025_10_02_114034_create_group_user_table.php
- database/migrations/2025_10_02_121642_add_last_login_at_to_users_table.php

**Inactive User Management System:**
- **Problem Solved:** Removed confusion around "inactive" status - it's now a system-determined state, not a manual selection
- **Database Changes:**
  - Added `last_login_at` timestamp field to users table (migration 2025_10_02_121642)
  - Tracks when each user last logged in
- **Backend Logic:**
  - AuthController: Updates `last_login_at` on every successful login
  - UserController:
    - Removed 'inactive' from validation rules (only trial/active/suspended allowed)
    - Added `deleteInactiveUsers()` method to delete trial users inactive for 30+ days
  - New endpoint: POST /api/v1/users/delete-inactive (admin-only)
  - Inactive definition: Trial users with no login in 30 days OR never logged in
- **Frontend Changes:**
  - Dashboard.tsx:
    - Default account_status changed to 'trial' (not 'inactive')
    - Removed 'Inactive' option from Create/Edit user status dropdowns
    - Added red "Delete Inactive Users" button in User Management
    - Shows confirmation dialog with count of deleted users
  - UserDashboard.tsx:
    - Trial user warning changed to red alert style
    - Message: "⚠️ Features limited! Upgrade your trial account to unlock the full features of Pagevoo."
    - Red "Upgrade Now" button instead of amber "Choose a Package"
  - api.ts: Added deleteInactiveUsers() method

**User Lifecycle:**
1. User registers → status: 'trial', last_login_at: null
2. User logs in → last_login_at updated to current timestamp
3. After 30 days of inactivity → Admin can bulk delete via "Delete Inactive Users" button
4. User upgrades package → status changes to 'active'

### Session 7 - Date: 10/2/2025 (Journal System & UI Improvements)

**Journal/Notes System (Niche & Pro Users):**
- **Database Schema:**
  - Created `notes` table (id, user_id, title, content, timestamps)
  - Created `note_shares` table (polymorphic sharing with users/groups)
