WORK COMPLETED:

### Session 1 - Date: 10/1/2025 (Early)
The website scaffolding has been mostly put together. So far we have created the react/vite/typescript frontend and php/mysql project with an API interface tested.

### Session 2 - Date: 10/1/2025 (Homepage Design)
**Design System Implemented:**
- Corporate colors established: #98b290 (light green) and #4b4b4b (grey)
- Added Pagevoo logos (standard 500x200 and wide version) to public folder
- Dark footer color: #171717

**Components Created:**
1. **Header Component** (fixed/sticky navigation)
   - Logo integration (Pagevoo_logo_500x200.png)
   - Navigation links (Features, Templates, Pricing, About) - all aligned right
   - User icon (circular green button) - appears when scrolled past account box
   - Conditional "Create New" button (shows only when user is logged in)
   - Mobile hamburger menu (green circular button) with dropdown
   - Scroll-aware behavior for account button visibility

2. **Hero Component**
   - Wide logo image (Pagevoo_logo_wide.png) as main heading
   - Corporate color gradient background (grey)
   - Account box with expandable login form:
     - Positioned top-right on desktop, centered above content on mobile
     - Animated expansion on "Login" click (full width on mobile, 320px on desktop)
     - Login/Sign Up buttons (collapsed state)
     - Username/Password inputs (expanded state)
     - "Forgot?" and "Cancel" links
     - User icon with green circular background

3. **FeatureSections Component**
   - "What is Pagevoo?" section with corporate colors
   - "PLATFORM 1.0" section with feature list

**Responsive Design Features:**
- Fixed header with proper content padding

- Mobile navigation menu with hamburger icon
- Corporate colors and styling consistent across all breakpoints

**Git Status:**
- Latest commit: 18d7d24 "Work to the homepage"
- All changes pushed to origin/main

### Session 3 - Date: 10/1/2025 (Routing & Brand Repositioning)
**Routing Implementation:**
- Installed React Router v7.9.3
- Set up BrowserRouter with route structure
- Created 5 pages: Home, Solutions, What's Included, Pricing, Support
- Updated Header component with Link components for navigation
- Mobile menu closes on navigation link click

**Brand Repositioning (Business Solution vs Website Builder):**
- Changed messaging to emphasize "turnkey business solution" not DIY website builder
- Updated navigation: Solutions (not Templates), What's Included (not Features)
- Hero section updated:
  - Main headline: "Launch your business website in minutes, not months"
  - Subheadline: "Industry-specific websites with booking, ordering, CMS, and everything your business needs — ready to go"
- Feature sections repositioned:
  - "What is Pagevoo?" - Emphasizes no coding, ready-to-launch
  - "Everything Included" (was "PLATFORM 1.0") - Focus on complete business solution
  - Call-to-action: "Get Started Today" (was "Get Started Free")
  - Removed unverifiable "thousands of businesses" claim

**Pages Created:**
1. **Solutions Page** - Industry-specific solutions (Restaurants, Barbershops, Pizza Shops, Cafes, Gyms, Salons)
2. **What's Included Page** - All built-in features (Booking, Ordering, CMS, Galleries, Customer Management, Blog/Forums)
3. **Pricing Page** - Three tiers: Brochure (£19/mo), Niche (£39/mo), Pro (£59/mo)
4. **Support Page** - Contact, documentation, video tutorials

**Technical Details:**
- Routes: /, /solutions, /whats-included, /pricing, /support
- System fonts maintained for performance (no custom font imports)
- All corporate colors (#98b290, #4b4b4b, #171717) applied consistently across new pages

- [x] Add routing with React Router ✓
