Edit > Site CSS - Needs "body margin" and "body padding"

I would like that if I click on a section that the properties automatically switch to that (if for example site or page css is already active)

If the navbar is fixed, then content below needs to be moved down so it is not hidden. (Spacing needs to be added).

Inconsistency between simplified default padding and code padding as code padding is in rem and slide for simplified is in px.

The background-image repeat option is a little temperamental, it sometimes works it sometimes doesn't.

When an image is set as the logo then the logo and text are changed around, the logo disappears.
